## Overview

I developed a straightforward dynamic solution for the rating page and created some simple JavaScript within some HTML for the process.
For element queries, I use jQuery.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

I created a circle-shaped rating form, and I changed the property based on the user's clicks. I also created a thank-you section. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- jQuery
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I pick up some of the jquery default functionality and some corrections from the post.
